Title: 2031-2036 Timeline
Type: Timeline

2031
In April 2031, the Nereus Blackout caused a 14-hour power failure across the Cascadian Economic Zone. Millions were affected by the outage. Ilya Moreno joined the emergency investigation team. Initial reports cited cascading inverter failures.

2032
Moreno contributed technical analysis to the Grid Autonomy Act. The legislation focused on automated monitoring and fail-safe mechanisms. His recommendations emphasized human oversight in critical systems. The act passed with bipartisan support.

2033
New predictive stability models were deployed across Cascadian grids. Moreno led implementation teams. Grid reliability improved measurably within months. Cascadia became a reference case for energy reform.

2034
International observers studied the Cascadian response. Moreno presented findings at energy conferences. Other regions began adopting similar models. Energy automation standards evolved globally.

2036
The blackout was retrospectively cited as a turning point in infrastructure governance. Moreno’s role became widely recognized. Policy shifted toward hybrid human–AI oversight. Energy planning increasingly emphasized resilience.
