Type: Timeline

2030
In early 2030, governments across Europe began accelerating port automation initiatives. Labor groups expressed concern over rapid displacement. Anselma Krüger emerged as a public organizer during early consultations. Initial negotiations failed to produce binding safeguards.

2031
The Rotterdam Dockworker Walkouts halted operations at Europe’s largest automated port. Krüger acted as a spokesperson for striking workers. Media coverage framed the conflict as the first major human–automation labor standoff. The event triggered emergency policy reviews.

2032
The European Trade Assembly convened hearings on automation oversight. Krüger testified alongside economists and technologists. Her testimony emphasized human override requirements. These hearings directly informed legislative drafting.

2033
The Human Override Statute was passed, mandating supervisory authority in autonomous logistics hubs. Krüger was credited as a key influence on the statute’s language. Industry groups expressed concern over compliance costs. Labor unions widely supported the measure.

2034
Similar labor movements emerged in other automated ports. Krüger helped coordinate cross-border union communication. The statute became a model for international labor protections. Automation policy entered mainstream political debate.
